<h1>Even More Demos!</h1>

<p>
	This is a collection of demos that is mostly to support our documentation with
	real working examples. That is why you shouldn't expect that they are as fancy
	as the others, however they are useful as example if you'd like to use one of
	the components provided by MooTools.
